# Hello, I'm Lucas Gardini! 👋

*Full-Stack TypeScript/.NET Software Developer (Web, Desktop & Mobile)*

## 👨‍💻 About Me

From **tinkering with computers as a kid** to coding professionally today, my journey has been driven by curiosity and passion. I wrote my first programs in 2019 using Python, which built a strong foundation in problem-solving. Soon after, I discovered **TypeScript** – my true affinity – and never looked back, crafting robust and scalable applications with it ever since. 

I honed my skills through **competitive programming** during college, participating in three programming marathons. These experiences, along with an early project building a restaurant management system in high school, set the stage for my career. In true developer fashion, I'm always looking to **level up** my skills (continuous improvement is my never-ending *training arc* ✨). I love sharing knowledge with my peers and adopting new tools and best practices. 

Outside of work, I'm a tech enthusiast who stays on top of the latest trends. Though I might be a bit of a quiet achiever, I thrive in team environments, contributing ideas and helping bring projects to life. I'm also a gaming and music fan 🎮🎵 (and let's just say a touch of anime inspiration never hurts!). My goal is to keep growing as a developer, **continuously learning** and taking on new challenges on the path to becoming a Tech Lead.

## 💼 Experience
**Asaas (Set 2025 – Present)** – *Joinville, SC, Brazil | Remote*

💻 *Mid-level Web Developer* (2025 - *) – Specialized in building and maintaining a large-scale web application using **Groovy and Grails**, with a strong emphasis on code quality and maintainability. I applied best practices such as clean architecture and performance optimization to ensure long-term stability. My work involved designing scalable features, improving developer experience, and enforcing coding standards through reviews and refactoring, always aiming for robust, elegant, and future-proof solutions.

**Integrativa (Jan 2022 – Aug 2025)** – *Catanduva, SP, Brazil*  
💻 *Senior Web Developer* (2025) – Leading projects and defining architecture for scalable web systems. In this role I design system **architecture**, build out **microservices** (Node.js/.NET) and **REST APIs** integration, and oversee **cloud infrastructure** and DevOps on AWS/Oracle Cloud. I also mentor team members and ensure our solutions follow best practices in security and performance.

💻 *Mid-level Web Developer* (2022 – 2025) – Developed end-to-end features for web and desktop applications. I worked on **API integrations** with external platforms, created web front-ends (Vue.js/Angular) and back-ends (Node.js, .NET), and built desktop apps using Electron and Tauri. I also implemented automation scripts (Python/JavaScript) to streamline processes, developed mobile app prototypes with React Native, and managed cloud servers (AWS, Oracle) for deployment. 

*(Earlier at Integrativa, I started as a Junior Web Developer, quickly progressing by consistently delivering quality code and innovative solutions.)*
